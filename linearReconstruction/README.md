# Linear Reconstruction

Contains code that runs a linear reconstruction attack.

This attack attempts to reconstruct data based on aggregates: bucket counts of distinct users across different combinations of columns.

## More information

Look at `basic.ipynb` to understand how the attack works and what the experimental parameters are (and to see the results of attacks).

## Files and directories

There must be a directory called `results` under the location where the code is executed.

Within `results`, files ending in `results.json` contain the experimental results. Files ending in `prob.lp` contain the problem constraints generated by the solver in LP format. Files ending in `prob.json` contain the problem in json format.

## To configure and run experiments

`python3 lrAttack.py` can can be used to run a single attack with a single experimental parameter set. The attack parameters can be set at the beginning of `__main``.

`python3 runAttacks.py` runs many attacks with combinations of attack parameters. The combinations are defined in `attackIterator()`.
